# 8. Work

The shape of data-mining work: the six steps under their usual data names, where to slow down,
the first slice, time boxes, the deadline pressure to find something, and what *done* means for a
claim. Read with [SE1 chapter 8](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/main/guide/08-work.md);
its queue and findings templates work unchanged.

### <a id="w1"></a>W1. CRISP-DM is the six steps, with the loop back to the question drawn in

*Reframes [SE1/W1](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/main/guide/08-work.md#w1).*

The standard process model for data mining, CRISP-DM, is SE1/W1's six steps under other names:

| SE1/W1       | CRISP-DM                                   | The product                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requirements | Business understanding, data understanding | the question, the decision, the unit, the outcome, the datasheet |
| Design       | Data preparation (its plan)                | the pipeline, the split, the analysis plan                |
| Develop      | Data preparation, modeling                 | transforms and models a second person can re-run          |
| Test         | Evaluation                                 | evidence the claim holds, against a baseline, with intervals |
| Deploy       | Deployment                                 | the claim or model in use, and a way back                 |
| Maintain     | (monitoring; usually left out)             | is it still true                                          |

CRISP-DM draws one arrow SE1/W1 only implies: from *evaluation* back to *business understanding*. In
data work that arrow is the common case. Evaluation regularly shows that the question was wrong — the
outcome was the wrong definition, the decision needed a different horizon — and the right next step
is to go back and rewrite the question, not to tune the model.

> **Ask:** "Did the evaluation answer the question — or tell us the question was wrong?"

### <a id="w2"></a>W2. Slow down around the one-way decisions: the question, the unit, the outcome, the split, the labels

*Reframes [SE1/W4](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/main/guide/08-work.md#w4).*

SE1/W4 chooses how carefully to work per decision, by the cost of being wrong once. Data work has an
unusual distribution of those costs: the expensive decisions all arrive early, when nothing has been
built and they feel cheap.

| Decision                                     | Cost of being wrong once                  | So                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Model class, hyperparameters, a feature      | a re-run                                   | loop fast                                       |
| Plot styling, report layout                  | minutes                                    | loop fast                                       |
| Outcome definition, unit, prediction point   | every feature, label, and result rebuilt   | write it, read it to the client, get an objection |
| The split strategy                           | every reported number invalid              | write it, have someone try to break it          |
| The labeling scheme                          | the labels, and the budget that bought them | pilot on fifty rows, measure agreement          |
| Spending the holdout                         | the only unbiased estimate you had         | once, at a decision ([DM1/F5](03-feedback.md#f5)) |

Most arguments in this field run at the wrong intensity: hours on the model class, minutes on the
definition of the outcome.

> **Ask:** "If this choice is wrong, what do we have to redo?"

### <a id="w3"></a>W3. Build a thin end-to-end slice first: one source, one feature, a baseline, the real chart

*Reframes [SE1/W6](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/main/guide/08-work.md#w6).*

The usual plan is horizontal: clean all the data, then engineer all the features, then model, then
report. Horizontal layers all finish at the same time — never — and the first contact between the
question and the data happens in the last week.

Instead, on day one: fetch one lot, compute one feature, score the baseline on a proper split, and
produce the actual chart the client will look at. Show it. Then thicken: more lots, more features, a
real model. Every K2 the slice exposes — the column that means something else, the timezone, the
missing peak — is exposed while there is time to respond.

> **Ask:** "Is there a version, however bad, that runs from raw data to the client's chart today?"

### <a id="w4"></a>W4. Time-box exploration and cleaning, and end each box on a fence

*Reframes [SE1/W8](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/main/guide/08-work.md#w8) and [SE1/W9](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/main/guide/08-work.md#w9).*

Exploration is the data form of SE1/W8's spike, and it falls down the waterfall the same way: one
more plot, one more join, one more week, and no claim at the end. Give each exploration and cleaning
pass a time box ([DM1/U5](02-unknowing.md#u5)), and end it on a **fence** — something proved, not
something attended:

- a baseline actually scored on the real split;
- a datasheet entry written for a source, including when each column becomes knowable;
- a plot a domain expert actually objected to;
- the pipeline run from a cold cache, from raw, with exit status zero;
- a null result written down.

A status meeting is not a fence. Neither is a notebook cell that ran.

> **Ask:** "What will we know when this box ends that we don't know now?"

### <a id="w5"></a>W5. The deadline pathology here is finding something; change the terrain, not the willpower

*Reframes [SE1/W7](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/main/guide/08-work.md#w7).*

SE1/W7's avoidance gradient applies, and in data work the behavior the spike produces is specific:
one more peek at the holdout, one more subgroup where the effect is significant, one more outlier
rule that helps, the sanity plot skipped, the null quietly not mentioned. **The pressure to find
something** is this field's characteristic deadline pathology, and it never feels like cheating
while it is happening. It feels like trying harder.

Change the terrain:

- **Make re-running cheap.** If raw to report is one command and a few minutes, "don't touch it, it
  works" stops being the safe move.
- **Write the plan and the bar first** ([DM1/R3](04-requirements.md#r3)), so a late change shows up
  as a departure.
- **Let the ledger count** ([DM1/F6](03-feedback.md#f6)), so the forty-first try is visibly the
  forty-first.
- **Report nulls when they happen** ([DM1/H3](09-people.md#h3)), so week eleven is not the first time
  anyone hears the effect isn't there.

> **Ask:** "What would make the last week before this deadline boring?"

### <a id="w6"></a>W6. Write down what you tried that did not work

*Reframes [SE1/W10](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/main/guide/08-work.md#w10).*

SE1/W10 keeps the working set in the repository. A data project's working set adds three things:
the question ([QUESTION template](../templates/QUESTION_v1.md)), the analysis plan
([PLAN template](../templates/PLAN_v1.md)), and the ledger of everything scored
([LEDGER template](../templates/LEDGER.md)).

The cheapest documentation in a data project, and the one nobody writes, is what did not work. Without
it, the next person — often you, months later — re-runs the same dead end, and the count of things
tried, which is part of the result ([DM1/F4](03-feedback.md#f4)), is lost with it. A dead end is a
finding: write it in FINDINGS with what it cost and what would have found it sooner.

> **Ask:** "If someone repeated this project from our repository, which dead ends would they walk
> into again?"

### <a id="w7"></a>W7. Done means someone else regenerated the number from raw and could argue with it

*Reframes [SE1/W11](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/main/guide/08-work.md#w11).*

SE1/W11: done means all of it, one concern per change, reviewed by someone else. For a claim, *all of
it* is:

- the number, with its interval, its slices, and the count of things tried;
- the command that regenerates it from raw, run by someone other than the author, producing the same
  number within the stated tolerance;
- the datasheet and, for a model, the model card, updated;
- the K4s written down, and read to the client ([DM1/H2](09-people.md#h2));
- a reviewer who read the *data handling* — the joins, filters, splits, and fills — not only the model
  code ([DM1/A6](10-agents.md#a6)).

> **Ask:** "Has anyone but the author regenerated this from raw?"
