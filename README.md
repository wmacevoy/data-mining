# Data Mining

A guide to producing claims from data that are worth acting on — written for humans and for the AI
agents working beside them. It is a companion to
[Software Engineering](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering) (`SE1`), and assumes it.

Software engineering asks *does the thing work*. Data mining asks *is the claim true* — and before
that, *would anyone act differently if it were*. Most of the discipline is the same, pointed at a
different noun, so this guide does not repeat SE1. Each principle here either **reframes** an SE1
principle for data (and links to it), or is **new**: something SE1 does not say because software
does not need it. Every principle says which, on the line under its heading.

It is organized as **numbered principles** with versioned IDs (`DM1/F5`, `DM1/D2`, `DM1/R6`, …),
in the same ten chapters, with the same letters, as SE1. Each states one idea and says why it is
true; most end with a question you can ask out loud in a meeting or a review: *"this holdout has
been looked at six times (DM1/F5)"*, *"this model is a cache of last season; how stale? (DM1/D2)"*.

## The argument in ten lines

1. **Data miners produce claims worth acting on.** A model is correct about a dataset; a claim is
   true about a world, and the gap between them is most of the work
   ([DM1/P1](guide/01-purpose.md#p1), [DM1/P2](guide/01-purpose.md#p2)).
2. **People ask about themselves; data answers about people like them.** The gap is bias, it falls
   hardest on whoever is rare in the rows, and like ethics and security it is always a requirement
   ([DM1/P3](guide/01-purpose.md#p3), [DM1/U8](guide/02-unknowing.md#u8), [DM1/R10](guide/04-requirements.md#r10)).
3. **Wrong analysis does not crash; it returns a number.** That makes data work a factory for
   confident error, and leakage is its signature: it feels like a good result
   ([DM1/U2](guide/02-unknowing.md#u2), [DM1/U3](guide/02-unknowing.md#u3)).
4. **The search is part of the result.** Every look at the outcome, every configuration tried, and
   every look at the holdout spends some of the evidence. Count them
   ([DM1/F4](guide/03-feedback.md#f4), [DM1/F5](guide/03-feedback.md#f5), [DM1/F6](guide/03-feedback.md#f6)).
5. **A point estimate is half a result**, and a large biased sample is confidently wrong
   ([DM1/F7](guide/03-feedback.md#f7), [DM1/F8](guide/03-feedback.md#f8)).
6. **Fix the decision, the unit, the outcome, and the moment of prediction first.** They are
   one-way doors that feel cheap in week one, and the errors have prices
   ([DM1/R1](guide/04-requirements.md#r1), [DM1/R2](guide/04-requirements.md#r2), [DM1/R4](guide/04-requirements.md#r4)).
7. **Know when each value became knowable.** Training on data as it looks now is using the future
   ([DM1/R6](guide/04-requirements.md#r6), [DM1/D3](guide/05-design.md#d3)).
8. **A model is a cache of the world at training time**, derived from raw data by one command, with
   its data, code, seed, and environment recorded ([DM1/D2](guide/05-design.md#d2), [DM1/D6](guide/05-design.md#d6)).
9. **Build the evaluation and a dumb baseline before the model; make the pipeline check itself**
   ([DM1/T1](guide/06-testing.md#t1), [DM1/T2](guide/06-testing.md#t2)).
10. **A model in production changes the data it will be trained on next** — the one-way door that
    does not look like one ([DM1/O11](guide/07-operating.md#o11)).

## How to read it

**People:** if you know SE1, read the chapters in order; each is short, because SE1 carries the long
arguments. If you don't, read SE1's first three chapters first (an afternoon), then this, following
the *Reframes* link whenever a principle leans on SE1. After that, use the index below and
[CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md). Terms used precisely are in [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md).

**Agents:** read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — the working agreement for data work — and SE1's
[AGENTS.md](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/v1.3/AGENTS.md), which it extends,
before acting in a repository that follows this guide. Then read the chapter that bears on the task
(the question → 4, pipelines and models → 5, evaluation → 3 and 6, production → 7). Cite principles
by ID when you raise a concern or explain a choice.

**Teams adopting it:** copy both AGENTS.md files into your repository and import them from your
agent's instruction file, and start your working set from the templates listed under
[Contents](#contents).

## The running example

SE1's running example is a parking-occupancy service for a stadium's lots: about a hundred lots, one
sensor per lot reporting free spaces every five seconds, a collector that marks each lot's count
`live`, `stale`, or `unreachable`, and an app for drivers and operators. This guide picks it up a few
seasons later. **The collector's history is now the data.**

- **The data.** Years of readings with their status; the event calendar; ticket sales by event; the
  weather; gate scans; attendants' radio logs of lots called full.
- **The client** is the same operations manager, who now asks for "machine learning to find patterns
  in the parking data." Underneath is a decision: two hours before gates open, which lots to staff,
  and which signs to light ([DM1/R1](guide/04-requirements.md#r1)).
- **Three questions** come out of that, one of each kind: *forecast* when each lot fills
  (supervised); *find* the sensors that drift or lie (anomaly detection); and *describe* how lots
  fill across event types (clustering and association — data mining in the narrow sense).
- **Built-in traps.** Final attendance is in the same table as ticket sales, and is not known until
  the event ends ([DM1/R6](guide/04-requirements.md#r6)). Sensors drop off the network most when a lot
  is busiest ([DM1/F8](guide/03-feedback.md#f8)). Two days a year are not 24 hours long
  ([DM1/D5](guide/05-design.md#d5)). The app's forecasts change where drivers park
  ([DM1/O11](guide/07-operating.md#o11)). And a later request to add license-plate reads turns a
  dataset about lots into a dataset about people ([DM1/R9](guide/04-requirements.md#r9)).

Course projects in the [fall 2026 course repository](https://github.com/wmacevoy/data-mining-wmacevoy-fall-2026)
apply these principles to real pipelines — a river-gauge dashboard and a people-counting occupancy
feed — with some violations left in place on purpose.

## Principle index

Every citation carries the guide's major version: `DM1/F5` is principle 5 of *Feedback* in the first
major version, and `SE1/F5` is a different principle in a different guide. Within DM1, a principle
may be reworded, but its ID never moves to a different idea; a retired principle keeps its ID with a
note saying where its content went, and new principles take the next number in their chapter. The
letters are the chapters, as in SE1: **P**urpose, **U**nknowing, **F**eedback, **R**equirements,
**D**esign, **T**esting, **O**perating, **W**ork, **H**umans (people), **A**gents. (Requirement IDs
in your own project should use a different form, such as `Q2/OUT-1`, so they are never confused with
these.)

**[1. Purpose](guide/01-purpose.md)**

- [**DM1/P1**](guide/01-purpose.md#p1) Data miners produce claims worth acting on, on time, within the data and compute they have, managing discomfort for the team, the client, and the people in the data
- [**DM1/P2**](guide/01-purpose.md#p2) Accurate is not true: a model is correct about a dataset; a claim is true about a world
- [**DM1/P3**](guide/01-purpose.md#p3) The people in the data are not in the room
- [**DM1/P4**](guide/01-purpose.md#p4) A practice that relieves the fear without reducing the risk is worse than nothing, and data work is full of them
- [**DM1/P5**](guide/01-purpose.md#p5) The deliverable is the claim and the means to re-derive it, not the notebook

**[2. Unknowing](guide/02-unknowing.md)**

- [**DM1/U1**](guide/02-unknowing.md#u1) Mining is discovering, in the right order and at the right price, which category each column and each step belongs to
- [**DM1/U2**](guide/02-unknowing.md#u2) Data work manufactures K3, because the failure is a returned value, not an exception
- [**DM1/U3**](guide/02-unknowing.md#u3) Leakage is the canonical K3: it feels like a good result
- [**DM1/U4**](guide/02-unknowing.md#u4) Every model is a chosen falsehood; name the direction it is wrong
- [**DM1/U5**](guide/02-unknowing.md#u5) Estimate the category: time-box the cleaning, estimate the modeling
- [**DM1/U6**](guide/02-unknowing.md#u6) A model always answers; give it a way to say "I don't know"
- [**DM1/U7**](guide/02-unknowing.md#u7) A summary statistic is a concussion: look at the rows
- [**DM1/U8**](guide/02-unknowing.md#u8) People ask Prob(result | me); the data holds Prob(result | the rows it counts as like me)
- [**DM1/U9**](guide/02-unknowing.md#u9) Whitespace is free on the inputs and spent on the outcome

**[3. Feedback](guide/03-feedback.md)**

- [**DM1/F1**](guide/03-feedback.md#f1) Tests of code are free; tests of a claim are not
- [**DM1/F2**](guide/03-feedback.md#f2) The cost of checking a result is designed, not given
- [**DM1/F3**](guide/03-feedback.md#f3) Push each class of error down to the cheapest loop that can catch it

- [**DM1/F7**](guide/03-feedback.md#f7) A point estimate is half a result
- [**DM1/F8**](guide/03-feedback.md#f8) A large sample does not rescue a biased one; it disguises it
- [**DM1/F9**](guide/03-feedback.md#f9) When a metric becomes a target, it stops measuring — and the search is the hardest optimizer you will meet

- [**DM1/R4**](guide/04-requirements.md#r4) The confusion matrix has a price
- [**DM1/R5**](guide/04-requirements.md#r5) Every column can be absent, late, wrong, or lying — and missingness is data
- [**DM1/R6**](guide/04-requirements.md#r6) Know, per column, when its value became knowable
- [**DM1/R7**](guide/04-requirements.md#r7) A label is an opinion with a timestamp
- [**DM1/R8**](guide/04-requirements.md#r8) The operating envelope includes rows, labels, compute, and expert hours
- [**DM1/R9**](guide/04-requirements.md#r9) Ethics, law, and security are requirements, and the people in the data never filed one

## Twelve questions

If you remember nothing else, each of these can be asked out loud, and each has an answer.

| Ask                                                                   | Checks |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| "Which decision does this change — and what if the answer were the opposite?" | [DM1/R1](guide/04-requirements.md#r1) |
| "What is one row, what exactly is the outcome, and when is the prediction made?" | [DM1/R2](guide/04-requirements.md#r2) |
| "Could the model have known this at the moment it would have to predict?" | [DM1/U3](guide/02-unknowing.md#u3) |
| "Which mistake is worse, by about how much, and who pays for each?"   | [DM1/R4](guide/04-requirements.md#r4) |
| "Would this result have survived if it were the only thing we tried?" | [DM1/F4](guide/03-feedback.md#f4) |
| "How many times has this holdout been looked at?"                     | [DM1/F5](guide/03-feedback.md#f5) |
| "What is the interval — and does the difference survive a different seed?" | [DM1/F7](guide/03-feedback.md#f7) |
| "For whom is this number systematically wrong — and who decided that was acceptable?" | [DM1/R10](guide/04-requirements.md#r10) |
| "What does the dumbest reasonable method score on this?"              | [DM1/T1](guide/06-testing.md#t1) |
| "If this join multiplied the rows, which line would fail?"            | [DM1/T2](guide/06-testing.md#t2) |
| "Where did this number come from, and could I regenerate it without asking anyone?" | [DM1/D13](guide/05-design.md#d13) |
| "What will this model change about the data we train the next one on?" | [DM1/O11](guide/07-operating.md#o11) |

## Changing this guide

The guide follows its own advice. Run `node tools/check.js` before committing: it fails if a link or
anchor is broken, a principle has no *New* or *Reframes* line, an SE1 citation points at the wrong
place, or the index or the SE1 map above no longer matches the chapters. With a copy of SE1 beside
this repository (`../software-engineering`, or `SE_GUIDE=path`), it also checks that every SE1 ID
exists; without one it says so. `node tools/check.js --print` prints the index and the SE1 map as
they should read, to paste in after adding or rewording a principle. Reword freely; never reuse an ID
for a different idea.

When SE1 changes, the reframing may need to change with it. A new SE1 principle that data work
sharpens is a new DM1 principle in the matching chapter.

## Where this came from

Refactored from the course document `DATA-SCIENCE.md` in the
[fall 2026 data mining course](https://github.com/wmacevoy/data-mining-wmacevoy-fall-2026), itself a
rewrite of an early draft of SE1, and reorganized to follow SE1's chapters and principle IDs. See
[READING.md](READING.md) for the sources the arguments lean on.

**This repository is the authority for these principles** ([SE1/D6](https://github.com/wmacevoy/software-engineering/blob/v1.3/guide/05-design.md#d6)).
**SE1 is the authority for everything this guide reframes**: where a DM1 principle and the SE1
principle it reframes seem to disagree about software, SE1 wins, and the DM1 principle has a bug.
